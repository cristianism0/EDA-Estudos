# EDA - Training

Repository to keep *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDAs) used to study Python Libraries and Jupyter Notebooks. 
Also, take notes and get codes to use constantily in other EDA's.

#### Clone this Repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cristianism0/EDA-Estudos
```
After this, you can open the directory and install all dependencies in enviroment.yml:
```shell
conda install -f enviroment.yml
```

Or, if want to create a new enviroment:
```shell
conda env create -f enviroment.yml
```

Now, you will have a `eda-study` enviroment, use: `conda info --envs` to se all of them.
```shell
conda activate eda-study
```
to activate the enviroment, and the use `deactivate` to turn it off.

## Main Goal

This repository is for study Python's most used Libraries for Data Science and Data Analysis:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)

## Data Sets
All data sets used here is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

- [Life-Style](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jockeroika/life-style-data?resource=download)
- [Spotify](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabihazahid/spotify-dataset-for-churn-analysis)


## Structure

- `eda/`: All notebooks with Notebooks.
- `notes/`: Notes from the EDAs and some insights.
